# Wright State University - Coursework Archive

Welcome to the WSU-Classes GitHub Organization\! This organization serves as a personal archive for coursework, projects, and notes from various Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CEG) courses at Wright State University.

The primary goal of this collection is to be a reference for past work, to demonstrate learning and progress over time, and to provide a centralized location for personal academic projects.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is intended for personal archival and educational purposes only. All visitors are expected to adhere to Wright State University's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.wright.edu/community-standards-and-student-conduct/academic-integrity). Do not copy, submit, or distribute any material from this organization as your own. Doing so is a violation of academic integrity and will have serious consequences.

## üìö Courses

Below is a list of courses with archived materials. Each course has its own repository containing relevant labs, assignments, projects, and notes.

### Computer Science (CS)

  * **[CS 1160: Introduction to Computer Programming](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS1160)**

      * An introductory course on the fundamentals of computer programming, typically using Python. Covers basic syntax, data structures, and problem-solving.

  * **[CS 1180: Computer Science I](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS1180)**

      * Focuses on foundational programming principles using a language like C++. Topics include variables, control structures, functions, arrays, and an introduction to object-oriented concepts.

  * **[CS 1181: Computer Science II](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS1181)**

      * A continuation of CS I, this course delves deeper into object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures (like linked lists, stacks, queues), and algorithms.

  * **[CS 3100: Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS3100)**

      * A comprehensive study of fundamental data structures and the algorithms that operate on them. Topics include trees, heaps, hash tables, graphs, and algorithm analysis ($O(n)$).

### Computer Engineering (CEG)

  * **[CEG 3320: Digital System Design with VHDL](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG3320)**

      * An introduction to digital logic and system design using the VHDL hardware description language. Covers combinational and sequential logic design and implementation on FPGAs.

  * **[CEG 4324: Mobile Application Development](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG4324)**

      * A project-based course on developing applications for mobile platforms like Android or iOS. Covers UI/UX design, platform-specific APIs, and the application lifecycle.

  * **[CEG 4350: Operating Systems](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG4350)**

      * A study of the principles and concepts of modern operating systems. Topics include process management, memory management, file systems, scheduling, and concurrency.
