# Wright State University - Coursework Archive

Welcome to the WSU-Classes GitHub Organization\! This organization serves as a personal archive for coursework, projects, and notes from various Computer Science (CS) and Computer Engineering (CEG) courses at Wright State University.

The primary goal of this collection is to be a reference for past work, to demonstrate learning and progress over time, and to provide a centralized location for personal academic projects.

**Disclaimer:** This repository is intended for personal archival and educational purposes only. All visitors are expected to adhere to Wright State University's [Academic Integrity Policy](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.wright.edu/community-standards-and-student-conduct/academic-integrity). Do not copy, submit, or distribute any material from this organization as your own. Doing so is a violation of academic integrity and will have serious consequences.

## üìö Courses

Below is a list of courses with archived materials. Each course has its own repository containing relevant labs, assignments, projects, and notes.

### Computer Science (CS)

  * **[CS 1160: Introduction to Computer Programming](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS1160)**

      * Basic concepts of programming in Python. Input/output, decision structures, repetition structures, functions, file operations, primitive data types and structures, object-oriented design, data analysis, and graphical user interfaces.

  * **[CS 1180: Computer Science I](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS1180)**

      * Introduction to object-oriented programming. Covers programming essentials such as variables, data types, control flow using iterations and decisions, array handling, and methods, building to design of classes and objects. Students will continuously practice the overall process of program development, starting with design and then coding, compiling, executing, testing, debugging, and documenting.

  * **[CS 1181: Computer Science II](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS1181)**

      * Advanced concepts of computer programming. Use of data structures and tools that facilitate programming.

  * **[CS 3100: Data Structures and Algorithms](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CS3100)**

      * Study of the implementation of data structures and control structures in professional computer programs. Introduction to the fundamentals of complexity and analysis. Study of common standard problems and solutions (e.g., transitive closure and critical path). Emphasis on high-level language software design.

### Computer Engineering (CEG)

  * **[CEG 3310: Computer Organization](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG3310)**

      * Organization and sequential operation of digital computers. Binary and hexadecimal number systems, 2‚Äôs complement arithmetic, program control, memory organization and hierarchy, addressing modes, stacks and parameter passing, interrupts and traps, I/O devices, DMA, cache, and virtual memory.

  * **[CEG 3320: Digital System Design](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG3320)**

      * Basics of digital computer hardware and design. Topics include switching algebra and switching functions, logic design of combinational and sequential circuits, storage elements, register-level design, and instrumentation.

  * **[CEG 4324: Digital Integrated Circuit Design with PLDs and FPGAs](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG4324)**

      * Digital design with behavioral level VHDL; application of VHDL to the design, analysis, and synthesis of digital integrated circuits; field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) and design and application of digital integrated circuits using FPGA‚Äôs. CAD tools, devices and boards will be used in the lab portion of the course. Topics include registers, counters, memory devices, register-level design, microcomputer system organization. Students must show competency in design of digital systems.

  * **[CEG 4350: Operating Systems](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/CEG4350)**

      * Overview of operating systems internals. File-system usage and design, process usage and control, virtual memory, multi user systems, access control. Course projects use C++ language.
   
### Electrical Engineering (EE)

  * **[EE 2010: Analog Circuit Theory](https://github.com/WSU-Classes/EE2010)**

      * Electrical quantities and their relationships, Transform-calculus impedance models of basic circuit elements, Conservation laws leveraging algebraic solutions, Transform-calculus-derived algebraic models of dynamic systems, and mathematical solution techniques.
